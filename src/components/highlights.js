                Dri-Scope Aid® Jet~Stream is designed to assist in the drying of
                the internal channels of an endoscope. The internal chan-nels
                are an ideal environment for colonization of bacteria. It is for
                this reason, SGNA, AAMI, AORN and scope manufac-turers all state
                that the internal channels of an endoscope should be purged with
                air until dry.

                Hygiena understands patient health and maximizing insurance
                reimbursements are essential to your business. Your success
                depends on the cleanliness of your facility. Published research
                shows that even with best efforts put forward, on average, only
                34-40% of hospital surfaces are actually cleaned to policy
                standards. Your constant battle against C. difficile, MRSA, and
                other healthcare-associated infections require a proven and
                effective cleaning verification program. Implementing a
                monitoring system improves cleaning thoroughness from 40% to
                82%1. The EnSURE Touch provides you with the data you need to
                ensure patient health and maximize insurance reimbursements.
